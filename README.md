# Sri Lanka Distircts

This is a simple Android app that presents a map of the country and a set of small maps of districts to the user. User can drag and drop the district to the correct location inside the country map. This also includes a simple multiple choise quiz.

This souce code can be used to implement simple drag and drop Android app. (ex. App for states/provices of another country). 
But drag and drop code in this app is buggy and has some issues, but I think it's good as a reference.
